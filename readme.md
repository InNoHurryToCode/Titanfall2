* Arc Rounds shield drain against Vortex and Flame Shields decreased fromn 5% per round to 3.3%.

### Future Content

* Decent chance that the next Frontier Defense maps are Angel City and Eden, judging by them already having (temporary) names for their waves.
* There's some stuff in the backend for Private Match settings that suggest you might be able to play Frontier Defense in there some time.
* Entitlement entries for a "Titanfall 2 Ultimate Edition" and "Titanfall 2 Jumpstarter Kit" have been released, presumably being the game bundled with some quantity of DLC.
* The next Pilot Execution will be for the Amped Wall. Who'da thunk. [I actually found the animations a while ago,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71SrKbiRx4) but there is now code in the execution script that is loading the AWall disc a prop, so it's extra confirmed.
  * No indication of what the unlock condition will be yet.

# Older Changes

## 27 June 2017 - The War Games

### Content and Feature Additions

* New Map: **War Games**
  * "Pilots on the Frontier frequently use simulator pods to train, using life-like recreations of historical battles as combat scenarios."
* New Live Fire Map: **Traffic**
  * "A weathered test site where pilot positioning is pitted against mobility across two busy thoroughfares."
* New Execution: **Shadow Boxing**
* New Mode: **Free Agents**
  * "Free-for-all with a twist. Collect 3 batteries to call in a Titan. Battery locations are placed around the map. Pilots drop batteries on death."
  * Featured mode, will be be in the featured slot eventually.
* Titan Brawl added to matchmaking queues.
  * Assist tracking replaced with Titan damage in Titan Brawl's scoreboard.
* Pilots can now carry 3 weapons, both a sidearm and an AT weapon.
* A buncha new Private Match settings.


### Rebalancing

#### Amped Weapons

* Amped Weapons is a now temporary boost, applying its effect for only 30 seconds after activation.
* Dropped Amped weapons will keep on ticking down the timer and can expire on their own, so while mugging Pilots for their Amped weapons can still work it won't be as effective.
* Respawn's patch notes claim that Amped damage has also been decreased, but there's nothing in the client to actually back that up. It might have been (another) last second change that had to be put out server-side or something?

#### R-97

* Very far damage decreased from 14 to 10.

### Fixes and Other Changes

* The Epilogue evacuation ship will now depart as soon as all living players have boarded.
* Various improvements to the CTF UI.
* Running over a Stalker now deals 1250 damage to Titans (the full damage of their power supplies). They've been painted red in MP to distinguish them from the less hurty ones in SP.
  * Titans approaching a Stalker will be shown an indicator arrow as if they were a grenade or Tick.
  * The explosion spawned by this *may* have a radius of 20 feet that could potentially cause collateral damage beyond just the Titan responsible; testing is needed. Pilots accidentally detonating Stalkers and damaging friendly Titans was already always a concern, this would be some hellish payback from the Titans to friendly Pilots.
* Monarch no longer accidentally gains two charges of smoke when using Overcore; this was actually fixed like ~2 weeks ago in the same server-sided change that brought the R97's very far damage down a bit more.
* Whenever it comes back, High TTK mode will support suppressors for pistols now.


### Future Content

* Entries for Prime skins have been added for each Pilot weapon in the text banks. Each Primary and Sidearm has 6 skins, while each AT weapon has 3.
  * It's not currently clear if these will be model variants or just unique textures, but the quantity of them points towards the latter.
* A new status effect has been added for "damage_received_multiplier". Jarate, anyone?
* Frontier Defense:
  * Plasma Drones have been added. You might remember them as the flying drones that fired small plasma shots in SP.
  * Titans class has been given **Frontier Defense-exclusive** upgrades, but it's not clear if these will be optional equipment, tied to boosts, or automatically applied in the mode:
    * All Titans
	  * 2500 extra HP
    * Ion
	  * Energy regeneration rate increase from 80/s to 100/s
	  * Maximum energy increase from 1000 to 1250
	  * Kills with Laser Core extend its firing time, 2 more seconds for titans, 1 second for Reapers, and 0.3 seconds for anything else
	  * Splitter Rifle shots consume 20 energy instead of 30 when split
	    * This would be 23 energy instead of 35 if using Refraction Lens
	* Tone
	  * 40mm Cannon blast radius increased to 14 feet from 9 feet
	  * 40mm Cannon can load 24 shells, doubled from 12
	  * Sonar Pulses last 8 seconds, increased from 5 seconds
	  * Sonar Pulses can do damage somehow
	  * Salvo Core outputs double the rockets
	* Monarch
	  * Threat-scope highlighting for XO-16
	  * XO-16 spread halved, and can zoom in further like the Railgun
	  * XO-16 rounds restore 35 shield per shot hit against enemy Titans
	* Ronin
	  * Gain Core Meter by blocking damage, formula seems to be (Damage blocked * 0.00007)
	  * 1.5x Phase Dash speed
	  * 1.25x Sword damage
	  * Two charges of Phase Dash
	  * Sword Core lasts twice as long
	* Northstar
	  * Railgun critical hit scale increase from 1.5x to 2.0x
	  * Railgun charges 1.7x faster
	  * "Attack Tethers", which are presumably tethers that will do damage somehow, but there's not any code for more details yet
	* Legion
	  * Gunshield health increase from 2500 to 7500 (Bulwark puts it at 5000)
	  * Two Power Shots and 1.15x recharge rate
	  * Smart Core lasts twice as long
	  * Larger spread for Close Range Power Shot
	  * Long Range Power Shots do 1.5x damage for every target the shell passes through
	  * 180 rounds loaded at once, increased from 100
	  * Normal Predator Cannon fire can pass through targets
	  * No movement speed decrease at all while Cannon is spun up
	  * 1.4x faster reload
	* Scorch
	  * Replace gas canisters with explosive barrels that detonate when damaged
	  * Flame Core sends out two waves
	  * All thermite damage increased to 1.2x
	  * Gain core at 1.5x normal rate
	  * Thermite Launcher can load 2 shells, upgradeable to 3 shells, and performs a per-shell reload like the Mastiff
  * Some things that will be on the minimap: Loadout Chest, Battery Exchange, Boost Store, Mortar Position, and Arc Traps.
  * Another new Boost: "Rodeo Grenade", or "Super Rodeo". No other details yet.
  * A sandbag prop has also been added. Probably just to be spawned around the map as extra cover, but it would be cool if they were a deployable or something.
  * Tablet and knife props has been added for Droz, while Gates has been given a P2016. For the intro animations, presumably.
* Prism versions of each of the Titan Regeneration callsigns have been added in devmode, but there are currently no associated unlock conditions.

## 30 May 2017 - Monarch's Reign

### Content and Feature Additions:

* New Titan: **Monarch**
  * "Mid-range Vanguard-class Titan that can upgrade itself on the battlefield."
  * Monarch Bounty Titans: *Sovereign*, *Empress*, *Tyrant*, *Viceroy*, and *Pharaoh*.  
* New Map: **Relic**
  * "Parts salvaged from this old IMC shipwreck are sent into the valley below for further processing."
* New Execution: **Now You See Me**
* Prime Titan: **Tone Prime**
* Prime Titan: **Ronin Prime**
* New Pilot Kit: **Titan Hunter**
  * Destroying a Titan gives an extra 10% to your Earn meter.
* Banners added for Generations 10 to 100.
* Buncha new cosmetics to buy.
* The feature to invite friends to a network from within the game has been added.

### Rebalancing:

#### Universal

* Damage done to Titan Shields now generate Earn/Core meter just like normal Titan damage.
* Titan Earn/Core meter percentage earned from damage dealt to other Titans decreased from 0.0075% to 0.007% per point of damage.
* Titan Executions can no longer be prevented by Titan Shields.

#### Tactikill

* Kills with the Tactikill weapon mod will now reward 25% of a tactical's charge instead of 33%.

#### R201/R101 Carbines

* Very far damage increased from 10 to 12.

#### Flatline

* Damage decreased from 35-30-20 to 30-25-15.
* Amped damage decreased from 50-35-25 to 45-35-20.

#### R-97

* Very far damage decreased from 16 to 14. Yep. That's it.

#### Volt

* Near damage increased from 23 to 25.
* Amped near damage increased from 25 to 35.
* Vertical recoil widened from -0.01Â°-0.1Â° per shot to -0.15Â°-0.35Â° per shot.
* Horizontal recoil increased from 0.0Â°-0.3Â° per shot to 0.1Â°-0.4Â° per shot.

#### X55-Devotion

* Damage decreased from 35-30-25 to 25-20-15.
* Amped damage decreased from 45-40-30 to 35-20-25.

#### Longbow DMR

* Amped damage decreased from 100 to 80.

#### RE-45 Autopistol

* Suppressed damage increased from 17-12-9 to 20-14-12.

#### Hammond P2016

* Near damage decreased from 45 to 40.
* Very far damage added, taking effect at 125 feet, and scaling down to 20 damage.
* Suppressed damage adjusted from 30-25 to 32-25-15.
* Amped very far damage added, set to 25.

#### SA-3 Mozambique

* Suppressed damage increased from 17-13 to 20-16.

#### Wingman

* Suppressed damage increased from 40-20-10 to 40-35-25.
* Amped near damage decreased from 100 to 90.

#### Ion

* Laser Shot maximum damage to Titans reduced from 2800 to 2400.
  * Nitty gritty: Laser Shot used to do 1400 damage on impact and up to another 1400 damage from its explosion, though that maximum damage was rarely properly applied in full thanks to how inconsistent explosive damage tends to be with direct hits. Both values have now been lowered to 1200.
* Laser Shot energy cost increased from 500 to 550 (out of 1000 total).
* Laser Core damage reduced from 350 to 325 (DPS reduced from 3500 to 3250).

### Fixes and Other Changes:

* Crash Site has a bunch of ziplines now and some improved collision clipping for player movement.
* Friendly turrets will now be visible on the minimap.
* CTF Flag Return radius redefined to 6.25 feet (previous value unknown).
* Network invites will now show the actual patches of everyone joining instead of just question marks.
* The manifestation of spooky flying ghost Gunshields should be fixed now.
* Scorch and Tone can no longer melee while their cores are active.
* Melee fixes, allegedly, again.


### Future Content:
*(note: details are somewhat speculatory based on sparse amounts of game code and text bank tokens)*

* The playlist setting "enable_coliseum_party" has been added, suggesting that something like a Wingman Coliseum mode might be coming soon.
* Settings for "low_ttk" and "tactical_rebalance" been added, probably for the "major balancing changes" that Respawn intends to play with as a featured mode. Judging from existing values, it might be a mode where everyone has half HP and will definitely have some various weapon performance changes. I will compile the changes to each weapon in a table some time soon, hopefully before the mode actually goes live.
* The typo in Archon's name introduced in the last patch was fixed, so that's still a big "maybe."
* Frontier Defense:
  * Added to the playlists settings:
    * 3 waves?
	* 2500 points to win?
	* 4 players
	* Definitely uses its own boost system
	* Not indicitive of anything, but only supports Angel City right now, as we saw in the roadmap image a few weeks ago.
  * New text was also added to display a player's "Frontier Level" and "Frontier Generation", so FD will likely use its own separate leveling system in addition to its own currency. With that in mind, it seems like FD is meant to be a completely separate mode of play, as in "Campaign, Multiplayer, and Frontier Defense."
  * Lots of new code added to the item/inventory system to complement that, allowing for a separate pool of unlocks and loadouts for FD.
  * More NPCs added, including ticks and AI settings for each base Titan type.
  * Code added so the gamemode can override your MP Faction setting, presumably to set you up to be in the 6-4 as mentioned in prior patch notes.
  * Some new code referring to an "Arc Trap" has appeared. The actual datablocks for it don't seem to be in the client, so anyone's guess what it is, but they'll be big enough to be visible on the minimap like a turret apparently. Classifying this as FD feature because [it's loaded alongside a bunch of other FD stuff in dev mode.](https://my.mixtape.moe/hrryst.png)
  * NPCs will be able to carry and lock-on with Archers.
  * A mod was added to Legion's Gunshield for NPCs to have it up indefinitely.
  * All anti-Titan weapons have received internal mods to support an infinite ammo pool.
  * New Boost Icons for the Boost Store: [Arc Traps, something for the Harvester, and the Nuke Titan drop.](https://my.mixtape.moe/yplnca.png) I think.
* Gamemode settings added for a team to share a Titan Earn/Core Meter, perhaps for a wacky featured mode?
* Code to track executions while a Holo Pilot is active has been added, and the item datablock for the Holo execution has been added, requiring 20 kills with a Holo active to unlock it. Seems this one *should* begin tracking now, but it might require you to run the game in dev mode first?
* Datablocks do *exist* for warpaints for Monarch, but the actual items in the arrays (which aren't in the VPKs) are disabled so I can't get a look at them. No clue why they're disabled to start with.

[â†µTop](#table-of-contents)

## 25 April 2017 - A Glitch in the Frontier

### Content and Feature Additions:

* New Map: **Glitch**
  * "Pilot Simulator"
  * "A medium-sized map designed for objective modes and inspired by Captain Lastimosaâ€™s home planet of Harmony. Vertical drops and long, twisting paths dominate the environment, perfect for chaining together long wall runs to seamlessly glide across the map."
* New Live Fire Map: **Deck**
  * "MRVN run facility for Pilot combat simulation and observation."
  * "Tight interior spaces, exposed courtyards, and watchful drones circling overhead. You may see a M.R.V.N. or two puttering around in the background."
* New Faction: **M.R.V.N. - *Marvin's Finest Hour***
  * For anyone who wants a little less chatter in their ear. If you'd still like to know what the MRVN unit is saying, you can turn on subtitles to see it all.
  * Call me crazy, but something about him smells of an ARG. Just gives me that feeling, with a dynamic day counter and previous hintings on the Titanfall Twitter...
* New Execution: **Get to the Point**
  * "Show your opponent up close how sharp a Pulse Blade is."
  * Pulse Blade execution. Unlock it by getting 10 kills with a Pulse Blade direct hit. May be unlocked retroactively if you already meet the requirement.
* New Featured Gamemodes:
  * **Titan Brawl**
    * "Think of this as Team Deathmatch with just Titans. 5v5 mode with Titans only (no ejecting or disembarking) and respawning in Titans. Each kill counts for 1 point and first team to 30 points wins."
  * **Iron Last Titan Standing**
    * "It's the Last Titan Standing you know and love with a few new rules. 5v5 with no ejecting and no batteries."
  * **Marked for Death**
    * "6v6. One member of each team is Marked as targets and both teams must defend their target while trying to kill the other teamâ€™s target. Once one of the marked players are killed, the surviving Markâ€™s team is rewarded a point. After a few seconds, new Marks are chosen. First team to 10 kills wins."
    * Titanfall 1 returnee
  * Each mode will be rotated around as featured modes
* Main menu spruced up with a new background video and some featured content highlights from Respawn.
* Pilot Regeneration cap raised from 10 to 100.
  * You'll get a new "Generation Card" attached to your calling card every 10 generations starting after G10.
* Live Fire maps and the mode are now available in Private Matches.
  * All maps support the Live Fire gamemode.
  * Live Fire designated maps (Stacks, Meadows, and Deck) support the Live Fire, Amped Hardpoint, Pilot vs Pilot, and Capture the Flag gamemodes.
* If you own them, you can now swap between Prime and Standard Titan executions for each of your Titans, or have it set to Random.
  * [There's also some nice hints about the Ronin and Tone Prime executions in there...](#future-content)
* When matchmaking is has found and is connecting you a to a match, it will helpfully make a sound to let you know so. If you're a PC player, make sure you've enabled *Audio* > *Sound In Background* so you can hear it when Alt+Tab'd.
* There is now a 1 in 100 chance of an "Easter Egg" dropship animation.

### Rebalancing:

#### All Titans

* Punches now have a limited angle of effect of 30 degrees. This is a fixed angle in front of you, similar to weapon spread.

#### Legion

* Ejecting will now cancel any charging Power Shot, preventing post-mortem shots.

#### Ion

* Laser Shot effective cone decreased from 1.5 degrees to 1 degree, and the crosshair has been scaled down to reflect this.
  * If you don't know what I'm talking about, [refer here for an explanation on how Laser Shot works.](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/5p7gs7/i_have_figured_out_why_exactly_ions_laser_shot_is/)

#### Arc Grenades

* Maximum charges decreased from 2 to 1.
* Cooldown time per charge decreased from 18.2 seconds to 12.5 seconds.

#### X-55 Devotion

* Amped close range damage decreased from 50 to 45.
* Amped very far damage decreaased from 40 to 30.

#### EVA-8 Shotgun

* Ideal damage distance decreased from 12.5 feet to 6.25 feet, meaning damage falloff will be much steeper.
* Pellet spread increased from 6 degrees to 8 degrees.

#### Mastiff

* Crosshair redesigned to more accurately represent pellet spread.
* First stage of bolt growth time/distance sped up from 0.075 seconds/4.3 meters to 0.025 seconds/1.4 meters.
  * If you don't know what bolt growth is: In a nutshell some projectile weapons' projectiles get bigger over time as they fly. Basically, the Mastiff's shots will become bigger faster. For more information about weapon bolt stats, [consult the table.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nxDADMLQfHCO6Z-hO0Dv5FJ1HSv7JsPEdcfQpoELRkg/edit#gid=1601279539)

#### Charge Rifle

* Close range anti-Titan damage raised from 825 to 1025. Long range anti-Titan damage raised from 525 to 725.
* Consequently, close range anti-Titan damage while using the Charge Hack mod raised from 575 to 775. Long range anti-Titan damage raised from 200 to 400.
* Amped close range anti-Titan damage raised from 1200 to 1400. Long range anti-Titan damage raised from 900 to 1100.
* Amped close range anti-Titan damage while using the Charge Hack mod raised from 950 to 1150. Long range anti-Titan damage raised from 575 to 775.

#### Archer

* Launch speed decreased from 76.6 MPH to 51 MPH.
* Turning speed decreased from 12.8 MPH to 5.3 MPH.
* Top speed decreased from 85.1 MPH to 59.6 MPH.
* Amped top speed decreased from 68.1 MPH to 55.3 MPH.

### Fixes and Other Changes:

* Ronin will now correctly block all damage consistently.
* Sunflares removed from Colony, Exoplanet, and Forwardbase Kodai. For whatever reason, this is done via a function which checks a setting in the current server playlist rather than just removing the entity from the maps themselves. Whatever floats your boat, Respawn.
* Hitting an Amped Wall will now produce hitmarkers, like with other particle walls.
* Weapons using the Tri crosshair (R-201, R-101, R97, CAR, G2A4, Hemlok) will no longer have the center dot disappear when firing.
* The reticle of the R-101's AOG will no longer be hidden when cloaked.
* Core Gain from Titan Damage in SP will now be the correct amount (0.01% per point of damage) rather than the value it was nerfed to in MP last patch (0.0075% per point of damage).
* The chat window will now be scootched down and out of the way of the Top 3 Pilots display at the end of a match.
* Network/Party Chat will remain persistent between matches.


### Future Content:
*(note: details are somewhat speculatory based on sparse amounts of game code and text bank tokens)*

* Thanks to the addition of a menu to select Titan executions, names have been provided for Ronin and Tone Primes' executions:
  * Tone: **Target Acquired**
  * Ronin: **Thunder and Lightning**
* Ramm (the Berserker/Fighter Ogre Titan) had his punch also specifically updated with the Titan punch nerf, with an effective angle of 45 degrees. If they're balancing him, maybe he's not completely off the table yet.
* On a related note, Archon (the Arc Cannon Stryder Titan) had his name token updated slightly. It almost seems like a typo (they moved an underscore into the middle of the word "Stryder", creating "NPC_TITAN_STRYDE_RARC"), but it's worth noting. Better safe than sorry.
* A new Titan Ability was added for Nuke Ejection. This is *probably* just for Frontier Defense.
  * It also has references to a "Spider" passive (Nuke Ticks?) and an "Ordnance Core" (for Mortar Titans?).
  * The Boost Activation "weapon" was updated to support a "Nuke Titan" boost.
* The Archer has received a "Mortar Mode" mod. Seems to give the rockets tickles for damage, so I imagine this is a placeholder for more Frontier Defense things as they work on them.
* The Kraber has received a "PVE Elite" mod. Raises its damage from 49 per round to 70 when used by NPCs. Sniper Spectres, here we come.
* Frontier Defense development continues, with new NPCs and features:
  * Mortar Spectres, who will be equipped with the above mentioned Archers with the Mortar mod. Curiously, they are seemingly set not to attack the Harvester, so they will presumably be expressly for Pilot suppression and harassment.
  * Boss Titans for each class. For now they seem mostly identical to normal NPC Titans, but also seem to have unique camos and decals associated with them.
  * Cloak Drones have been lying around for a while as a cut piece of equipment for Engineer Pilots, but have now had some movement stats tossed into them, so they'll likely be back for FD.
  * Specialists have had their model set to be the Shield Captains, confirming they will be some variant of them.
  * Pilot and Titan Sentries have had separate playertypes added for FD, with (effectively) no time limit but significantly less HP, 150 and 300 respectively.
  * It seems there will be a separate system of currency for PVE. Can't tell if it'll be persistent between matches or MOBA-styled currency that is only for the match, only that there'll be a starting amount of 500. [A few reward values for kills have already been set.](https://a.pomf.cat/jmkzxh.png)
  * Models for Droz and Davis are being loaded with "FD" prefixes, so I wonder who the player faction will be???
* Monarch development rolls along, with some varied additions and changes to existing files.
  * Only real new number: Superior Chassis will raise her HP from 10000 to 15000.
  * Some new unique assets now, rather than recycling Tone's animations.
* More support for minimap resizing and zooming added. Implementation to live when!?
* Some stuff discussing a "Boost Store". Burn Cards for Frontier Defense or something, maybe?

* For whatever reason, some grappling hook related properties were removed from the base Titan datablock
* Pilot levels now display during killcams
* Improvements made to audio when spectatin and rapidly swapping between viewpoints/perspectives
* Grappling hooks should not longer be caught in Vortex Shields

### Future Content:
*(note: details are somewhat speculatory based on sparse amounts of game code and text bank tokens)*

* New Titan: **Monarch**
  * *"Mid-range Vanguard-class Titan that can upgrade itself on the battlefield."*
  * Likely exclusive to Frontier Defense, god help us all if she isn't
  * Primary Weapon: XO-16 Chaingun. "20mm armor piercing automatic rifle." You know what it is
  * Offensive: Rocket Salvo. "Launches an unguided rocket swarm."
  * Defensive: Energy Siphon (internally, Stun Laser). "Slows enemies and generates Shields. Heavily armored targets generate more Shield." Seems to be a laser shot with these effects
  * Utility: Rearm. "Refreshes the cooldown of your Dash, Ordnance, and Defensive Ability."
  * Core: Upgrade Core. "Recharges your Titan's shields and upgrades your Titan in order of the upgrades above." Each upgrade level has 3 selectable kits that you may choose 1 of to apply when the Core is activated.
    * ***Level 1***
      * **Arc Rounds** - Increases ammo capacity and XO-16 rounds break through Defensive Abilities.
	    * Increases magazine capacity from 30 to 40 and seems to go through all shields
      * **Missile Racks** - Rocket Salvo fires twice the amount of missiles.
	    * As found earlier, 12 rockets per salvo instead of 6
      * **Energy Field** - Energy Siphon affects a large area around the point of impact.
	    * As found earlier, Energy Siphon's explosion radius increases from 3 feet to 25 feet
    * ***Level 2***
      * **Swift Rearm** - Rearm is almost instantaneous.
	    * As found earlier, 0.1 second activation time instead of 0.5 seconds
      * **Maelstrom** - Electric Smoke is intensified, dealing more damage to Titans and Pilots.
	    * As found earlier, increases Electric Smoke DPS against Pilots from 45 to 90 and DPS against Titans from 450 to 1350
      * **Energy Transfer** - Energy Siphon gives Shield to friendly Titans.
    * ***Level 3***
      * **Multi-Target Missiles** - Rocket Salvo can lock onto Titans and Reapers. Missiles fly faster and deal more damage.
	    * Apparently not yet implemented, I presume they are working on getting the MTMS to not lock onto human sized targets
      * **Superior Chassis** - Upgrades Monarch's health, dash, and melee capabilities.
	    * Not yet implemented, and no numbers to be found yet.
      * **XO-16 Battle Rifle** - Unlocks the hidden power of the XO-16, increasing precision, damage, and critical damage.
	    * Not yet implemented, and no numbers to be found yet.
  * Unique Titan Kits:
	* **Data Siphon** - Core Meter is earned 25% faster.
    * **Shield Amplifier** - Increases your Titan's max shield strength by 50%
	  * This would mean a shield with 3750 HP rather than 2500.
    * **Rapid Rearm** - Reduces the cooldown of Rearm by 5 seconds.
    * **Survival of the Fittest** - Batteries can repair the Monarch out of Doomed State.
    * **Apex Titan** - Enables a fourth and final upgrade.
	  * Apparently not yet implemented, with no fourth upgrade to be found just yet
    * No apparent fifth kit yet
  * There's even a Prime model in the item database
  * There are separate voice entries for "Vanguard" and "BT", I'd bet that BT will be the Prime voice
* Coop Bounty Hunt development continues, having now been fully rebranded internally as **Frontier Defense**, with some new NPC classes added for the mode:
  * No clear indications yet what Elite Guards are; my bet's on Shield Captains, but for now it's only clear that they have a new model
  * Specialists seems to be using the Phase Shift pilot model, spawn with L-STARs and *ticks* as an ordnance
  * Mortar Titans and Nuke Titans seem to be returning, using Tone and Scorch as their bases respectively
  * There's also a "Sandbox" NPC class that is likely an AI test dummy, with a Sandbox PVE mode also added for devs
  * Harvester will be the defense objective once more, with entities added for it
  * Seems to use a MOBA-style internal leveling system, with players choosing a "path" of tactical and following upgrades to their tactical. The tacticals themselves are Phase Shift, Grapple, and... Sword Block?
    * *Path 1* - ***The Ghost***
	  * Level 1 - **The Ghost**
        * Enter and Exit Phase Shift at Will
	  * Level 2 - **The Wisp**
	    * Fast Travel in Phase Shift
		  * More specifically, you seem to be permanently stimmed when inside the Phase realm
	  * Level 3 - **The Banshee**
	    * Destructive Exits from Phase Shift
		  * Explosions when you exit phase, with an impressive radius of 30 feet
	* *Path 2* - ***The Hook***
	  * Level 1 - **The Hook**
        * Unlimited Grapple
      * Level 2 - **The Acrobat**
        * Long-Distance Grapple
	      * Dramatically increases maximum line distance from 68 feet to 187 feet
      * Level 3 - **The Devastator**
         * Assault Grapple
	      * As found earlier, the hook explodes when making contact with surfaces
	* *Path 3* - ***The Blade***
      * Level 1 - The Blade
	    * Hold to Block, Powerful Melee
	      * Gives you a Pilot Sword for your melee, and Sword Block as your tactical. Not 100% clear on how its damage mitigation works yet
	  * Level 2 - The Assassin
		* Strike from Far Away
		  * As found earlier, drastically increases melee lunge distance from the base 8 feet to 48 feet
	  * Level 3 - The Machine Hunter
		* Effective Against Titans
		  * As found earlier, the sword's power increases and become capable of damage to Titans for 1000 damage per swing
	* *Path 4* - ***The Wall***
	  * No details currently available, but it doesn't take datamining to guess that this will be the Amped Wall's tactical path
	* *Path 5* - ***The Hound***
	  * No details currently available, but I'm willing to bet this path will belong to the Pulse Blade
	* *Path 6* - ***The Jester***
	  * No details currently available, but this should be the Holo Pilot guessing from the name
* Previously leaked modes have had code moved into their own files from the global MP properties file, development moving along
* Communications and emoticons are likely to come *very* soon, with an announcement text already being the in textbanks (https://my.mixtape.moe/rwrqqi.png) to be rolled out at any time
  * Seems it'll be a simple quick chat menu to point out objectives, commend teammates, and send emoji? No clue if it'll be voiced or anything
* Some support added for the minimap to be zoomed in or out by the player, surprised this isn't already implemented
* Seems like it'll be possible to invite friends to a network from within the game rather than having to mess with the official website

### Future Content:

*(note: details are somewhat speculatory based on sparse amounts of game code and text bank tokens)*

#### Gamemode: Hunted

* "Secure the Asset. Escape the Hunter."
* 4 on 4, 1 flag CTF?
* 1 team defending, another attacking
* Various objectives serving as "the asset", with black box to be extracted
* Prowlers and Shield Captain enemies returning from SP to help defense
* Includes weapon lockers for resupply
* No Titans, no Boosts

#### Gamemode: RAID

* "Plant a bomb at the enemy hardpoint. Protect yours from the same."
* Titanfall: Global Offensive

#### Gamemode: Double or Nothing

* "Kill both members of the enemy team."
* 2 on 2 elimination
* Includes a unique bleedout mechanic to allow teammates to revive one another.

#### Gamemode: Co-op Bounty Hunt

* "Kill all enemy waves."
* Frontier Defense without a defense objective?
* Seems like it'll be about as harsh with enemy waves, includes resupply lockers and deployable unlocks; maybe the Engineer class equipment will finally get used?
* Confusingly, there is data such as "money earned for a player Pilot/Titan Kill"

#### Gamemode: Marked for Death

* "Kill the marked Pilot."
* Titanfall 1 returnee
* Has been sitting alongside the older mode notes for a while as a leftover from R1, but some new mode objective and score event text was added with this patch, so I think we can safely surmise that it is planned to be rereleased in R2

#### Weapon: R-101x Carbine
* "Factory issue scoped predecessor of the R-201 rifle."
* Exact same performance as R-201 but with the Titanfall 1 model (probably)
* Comes with an AOG in place of iron sights
* Entertainingly, is missing the dismemberment tag that the R-201 just had added, hopefully that's fixed before the weapon is pushed to release

* Titanfall 1 returnee

#### Map: Colony
* "IMC and Militia forces clash in the close-quarters of an uncharted rural colony."
* Titanfall 1 returnee

#### Map: Township

#### Map: Traffic

#### Map: UMA

#### Map: Deck

#### Map: MOUT

#### Execution: Curb Check

* "Curb check with style using your grapple."
* Grapple rope execution, confirming the tactical-inspired execution agenda
* Seems to involve head stabbing??

#### Feature: Communication

* Some recent commented out code suggests that there is a communication wheel and unlockable emotes coming soon, or at least in development

#### Tactical: Super Phase Shift

* I have no idea. Probably a dev tool, but seems to just be Phase Shift with a duration of 999999

#### Prime Titan: Northstar

* Execution will involve probably Flight Core, using dummy versions of the Tone's tracker rockets

#### Prime Titan: Legion
